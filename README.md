# GameProject
Mini game project for student class.

This is a simple game where you move the main character (Panda) by using the right, left, down keys. With the spacebar, you can make a jump. 
The game is to collect all the leaves (the program counts them on the table record). 
The main character has a limited number of lives. 
You should watch out for bombs, which explode when the main character comes into contact with them, taking away his life. 
The game has 4 levels, with each level the difficulty grows.
